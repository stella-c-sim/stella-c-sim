# Hi 👋 Welcome to my Github Profile!

I am Stella and I am interested in all things data and machine learning. I am currently working as a Lead Analyst with 7+ years of experience and located in Atlanta, GA. In my free time, I like to make music, do yoga, play with my fur babies, and travel.

Check out my [Portfolio](https://github.com/stella-c-sim/Portfolio) to view my projects and skills. I am still adding projects from my MIT coursework, so be on the lookout for new projects!
